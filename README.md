There are currently 2 problems. 


Problem 1
page 1. The index.html page 2. is beet-article.html. : in smaller view widths the hamburger menu shows up. It makes it so that the links on the articles do not work. I have tried resizing the width of .menu-wrap and .menu which works, but doesn't look great.




page 3. is request.html. I need to gain control of the video to stop it when the reset button is clicked


Any help would be much appriciated
