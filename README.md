# farm-blog
A Blog for my personal farm

Index.html is the main page. The main nav is resposive and turns into a hamburger menue at 700px width. The links are 2 diffrent colors using the nth-child selector. The first 2 links on the nav menu will take you to the other 2 pages; the other 2 links just take you to the top of the page. There is also a link on the first singleBlog link in the main section of the page. All other article links will take the user to the top of the page unless you click the actual button which will cue an alert with a fact associated with the picture.

The latest article link will take you to beet-article.html.The aside section moves from the bottom to the right side of the page at the 700px min width the links on the aside section are external links.

The third page is the Form which is request.html. There are 4 form fields. The Email field verifies that what is inputted is "valid". Once the form is filled out and the submit button is clicked a couple sentances appear that use the information provided in the fields. A youtube video also appears that I hope you will enjoy as much as I do. When the reset button is clicked the feilds are reset and the sentances + video dissapear.
