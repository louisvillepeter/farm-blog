Blog for personal farm

There are currently 3 pages. 

page 1. The index.html which has 8 artlcles. Only the fisrt one has a working link. There is a hamburger menu controlled by a media query whic has a 700px max width. I tried to do everything mobile first, but had trouble getting it to work with the other menue/elements on the page so I did it this way. the rest of the media queries are min width.

page 2. is beet-article.html. I mostly worked on getting the aside to work and ajust to diffrent screen sizes.

page 3. is request.html. I don't really feel like this makes any sense in the context of the larger page, but I got excited about using javascript to create a mad libs style game. I gave the drop down lists options number values, but am having trouble getting it to work. What I want to have happen is when the submit button is clicked the EventListner would record the number values for the each and add/subtract to creat a new variable "roll" I then want the value of roll to determin what story is told. I also need to somehow record the word the user has selected from each of the 3 the drob down menues and reinsert them as string value into the paragraph of the story so it makes sense. I worked on it for like 10 hours today and I just can't quite get it to work all together.


Any help would be much appriciated
