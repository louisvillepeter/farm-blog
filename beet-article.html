                               'M gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?

                            That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.
                            
                            Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This piece of canvas is your world. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.
                            
                            Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes?
                            
                            Just a little indication. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. A fan brush can be your best friend. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.
                            
                            This painting comes right out of your heart. Everybody needs a friend. There we are.
                            
                            See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Son of a gun. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Let's do that again.
                            
                            There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.
